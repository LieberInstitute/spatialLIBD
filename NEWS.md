# spatialLIBD 0.99.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* First full version of the package to be submitted to Bioconductor. Note that
the `ExperimentHub::ExperimentHub()` functionality won't work until they
approve the package. However, for now `fetch_data()` has a backup mechanism
in place.
