# spatialLIBD 0.99.3

* Further refine the READMEs (pkg and shiny). They now include the list of
links to the raw 10x Genomics files as well as a short description of the
project at the top. This was in response to feedback by Andrew Jaffe.

# spatialLIBD 0.99.2

* Update main package READMEs to reflect the changes to the shiny web app README.md.

# spatialLIBD 0.99.1

* Added Kristen R Maynard to the DESCRIPTION file.
* Improved the shiny app page footer.
* Moved around the documentation and added a new main tab with an overview in
response to the feedback by Stephanie Hicks.

# spatialLIBD 0.99.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* First full version of the package to be submitted to Bioconductor. Note that
the `ExperimentHub::ExperimentHub()` functionality won't work until they
approve the package. However, for now `fetch_data()` has a backup mechanism
in place.
* Submitted to Bioconductor [here](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions/issues/1389).
