Welcome to the `spatialLIBD` project! It is composed of:

* a [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application that we are hosting at [spatial.libd.org/spatialLIBD/](http://spatial.libd.org/spatialLIBD/) that can handle a [limited](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD/issues/2) set of concurrent users,
* a Bioconductor package at [bioconductor.org/packages/spatialLIBD](http://bioconductor.org/packages/spatialLIBD) (or from [here](http://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/)) that lets you analyze the data and run a local version of our web application (with our data or yours),
* and a [research article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00787-0) with the scientific knowledge we drew from this dataset. The analysis code for our project is available [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/HumanPilot/) and the high quality figures for the manuscript are available through [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13623902.v1).

The web application allows you to browse the LIBD human dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC) spatial transcriptomics data generated with the 10x Genomics Visium platform. Through the [R/Bioconductor package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/spatialLIBD) you can also download the data as well as visualize your own datasets using this web application. Please check the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00787-0) or [bioRxiv pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.969931v1) for more details about this project.

If you tweet about this website, the data or the R package please use the <code>#spatialLIBD</code> hashtag. You can find previous tweets that way as shown <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23spatialLIBD&src=typed_query">here</a>. Thank you! <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=spatialLIBD&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-hashtag-button" data-show-count="false">Tweet #spatialLIBD</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Study design

As a quick overview, the data presented here is from portion of the DLPFC that spans six neuronal layers plus white matter (**A**) for a total of three subjects with two pairs of spatially adjacent replicates (**B**). Each dissection of DLPFC was designed to span all six layers plus white matter (**C**). Using this web application you can explore the expression of known genes such as _SNAP25_ (**D**, a neuronal gene), _MOBP_ (**E**, an oligodendrocyte gene), and known layer markers from mouse studies such as _PCP4_ (**F**, a known layer 5 marker gene).

<img src="man/figures/paper_figure1.jpg" align="center" width="800px" />

This web application was built such that we could annotate the spots to layers as you can see under the **spot-level data** tab. Once we annotated each spot to a layer, we compressed the information by a pseudo-bulking approach into **layer-level data**. We then analyzed the expression through a set of models whose results you can also explore through this web application. Finally, you can upload your own gene sets of interest as well as layer enrichment statistics and compare them with our LIBD Human DLPFC Visium dataset.

If you are interested in running this web application locally, you can do so thanks to the `spatialLIBD` R/Bioconductor package that powers this web application as shown below.

```{r run_app, eval = FALSE}
## Run this web application locally
spatialLIBD::run_app()

## You will have more control about the length of the
## session and memory usage.

## You could also use this function to visualize your
## own data given some requirements described
## in detail in the package vignette documentation
## at http://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/.
```

## Shiny website mirrors

* [Main shiny application website](http://spatial.libd.org/spatialLIBD/) (note that the link must have a trailing slash `/` for it to work)
* [Shinyapps](https://libd.shinyapps.io/spatialLIBD/) This version has less RAM memory but is typically deployed using the latest version of `spatialLIBD`.

## R/Bioconductor package

The `spatialLIBD` package contains functions for:

* Accessing the spatial transcriptomics data from the LIBD Human Pilot project ([code on GitHub](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/HumanPilot)) generated with the Visium platform from 10x Genomics. The data is retrieved from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/)'s `ExperimentHub`.
* Visualizing the spot-level spatial gene expression data and clusters.
* Inspecting the data interactively either on your computer or through [spatial.libd.org/spatialLIBD/](http://spatial.libd.org/spatialLIBD/).

For more details, please check the [documentation website](http://lieberinstitute.github.io/spatialLIBD) or the Bioconductor package landing page [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/spatialLIBD).

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `spatialLIBD` from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("spatialLIBD")
```

If you want to use the development version of `spatialLIBD`, you will need to use the R version corresponding to the current Bioconductor-devel branch as described in more detail on the [Bioconductor website](http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/useDevel/). Then you can install `spatialLIBD` from GitHub using the following command.

```{r "install_devel", eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("LieberInstitute/spatialLIBD")
```



## Access the data

Through the `spatialLIBD` package you can access the processed data in it's final R format. However, we also provide a table of links so you can download the raw data we received from 10x Genomics.

### Processed data

Using `spatialLIBD` you can access the Human DLPFC spatial transcriptomics data from the 10x Genomics Visium platform. For example, this is the code you can use to access the layer-level data. For more details, check the help file for `fetch_data()`.

```{r 'access_data', message=FALSE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 9}
## Load the package
library("spatialLIBD")

## Download the spot-level data
spe <- fetch_data(type = "spe")

## This is a SpatialExperiment object
spe

## Note the memory size
lobstr::obj_size(spe)

## Remake the logo image with histology information
vis_clus(
    spe = spe,
    clustervar = "spatialLIBD",
    sampleid = "151673",
    colors = libd_layer_colors,
    ... = " DLPFC Human Brain Layers\nMade with research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/"
)
```


### Raw data

You can access all the raw data through [Globus](http://research.libd.org/globus/) (`jhpce#HumanPilot10x`). Furthermore, below you can find the links to the raw data we received from 10x Genomics.

```{r 'AWS_links', eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
## Read in the table of links from the HumanPilot repository
## Since this depends on another repo, I set eval to FALSE.
aws_links <-
    read.table(
        "../HumanPilot/AWS_File_locations.tsv",
        header = TRUE,
        stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
## Format into markdown links
for (i in seq_len(ncol(aws_links))[-1]) {
    aws_links[[i]] <- paste0("[AWS](", aws_links[[i]], ")")
}
aws_links$`HTML_report` <- paste0("[GitHub](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/HumanPilot/blob/master/10X/", aws_links$SampleID, "/", aws_links$SampleID, "_web_summary.html)")

## Print the table
knitr::kable(aws_links, caption = "Links to the Human DLPFC Visium raw data files", format = "markdown")
```
