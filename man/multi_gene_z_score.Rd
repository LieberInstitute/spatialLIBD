\description{
PCA is performed on \code{cont_mat}, the matrix of multiple continuous
features. The first PC is returned, representing the dominant spatial
signature of the feature set. Its direction is negated if necessary so that
the majority of coefficients across features are positive (when the features
are highly correlated, this encourages spots with higher values to
represent areas of higher expression of the features).

To summarize multiple features, the proportion of features with positive
values for each spot is computed.

To summarize multiple features, each is normalized to represent a Z-score.
Scores are averaged to return a single vector.
