\title{Cell cluster t-statistics from Tran et al}
\format{
A matrix with 692 rows and 31 variables where each column is
a given cell cluster from Tran et al and each row is one gene. The row names
are Ensembl gene IDs which are used by \code{\link[=layer_stat_cor]{layer_stat_cor()}} to match to
our modeling results.

\description{
Using the DLPFC snRNA-seq data from Matthew N Tran et al
\url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.09.001} we computed
enrichment t-statistics for the cell clusters. The Tran et al data has been
subset to the top 100 DLPFC layer markers found in Maynard, Collado-Torres,
et al 2021. This data is used in examples such as in
\code{\link[=layer_stat_cor_plot]{layer_stat_cor_plot()}}. The Tran et al data is from the pre-print version
of that project.
