\usage{
layer_stat_cor(
  stats,
  modeling_results = fetch_data(type = "modeling_results"),
  model_type = names(modeling_results)[1],
  reverse = FALSE,
  top_n = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stats}{A data.frame where the row names are Ensembl gene IDs, the
column names are labels for clusters of cells or cell types, and where
each cell contains the given statistic for that gene and cell type. These
statistics should be computed similarly to the modeling results from
the data we provide. For example, like the \code{enrichment} t-statistics that
are derived from comparing one layer against the rest. The \code{stats} will be
matched and then correlated with our statistics.}

\item{modeling_results}{Defaults to the output of
\code{fetch_data(type = 'modeling_results')}. This is a list of tables with the
columns \verb{f_stat_*} or \verb{t_stat_*} as well as \verb{p_value_*} and \verb{fdr_*} plus
\code{ensembl}. The column name is used to extract the statistic results, the
p-values, and the FDR adjusted p-values. Then the \code{ensembl} column is used
for matching in some cases. See \code{\link[=fetch_data]{fetch_data()}} for more details.}

\item{model_type}{A named element of the \code{modeling_results} list. By default
that is either \code{enrichment} for the model that tests one human brain layer
against the rest (one group vs the rest), \code{pairwise} which compares two
layers (groups) denoted by \code{layerA-layerB} such that \code{layerA} is greater
than \code{layerB}, and \code{anova} which determines if any layer (group) is different
from the rest adjusting for the mean expression level. The statistics for
\code{enrichment} and \code{pairwise} are t-statistics while the \code{anova} model ones
are F-statistics.}

\item{reverse}{A \code{logical(1)} indicating whether to multiply by \code{-1} the
input statistics and reverse the \code{layerA-layerB} column names (using the \code{-})
into \code{layerB-layerA}.}

\item{top_n}{An \code{integer(1)} specifying whether to filter to the top n marker
genes. The default is \code{NULL} in which case no filtering is done.}
}
\value{
A correlation matrix between \code{stats} and our statistics using only
the Ensembl gene IDs present in both tables. The columns are sorted using
a hierarchical cluster.

\examples{

## Obtain the necessary data
if (!exists("modeling_results")) {
    modeling_results <- fetch_data(type = "modeling_results")
}

## Compute the correlations
cor_stats_layer <- layer_stat_cor(
    tstats_Human_DLPFC_snRNAseq_Nguyen_topLayer,
    modeling_results,
    model_type = "enrichment"
)

## Explore the correlation matrix
head(cor_stats_layer[, seq_len(3)])
summary(cor_stats_layer)

## Repeat with top_n set to 10
summary(layer_stat_cor(
    tstats_Human_DLPFC_snRNAseq_Nguyen_topLayer,
    modeling_results,
    model_type = "enrichment",
    top_n = 10
))
